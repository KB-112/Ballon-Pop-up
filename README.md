Introduction
Hello there! 👋 I'm Kb, a generalist Unity programmer still exploring the vast world of game development. 🌍 Let's embark on a coding adventure together! 🕵️‍♂️

I've created a 2D Hypercasual Game called Balloon Pop. It's a simple yet fun game where you must pop balloons before they float away. 🎈

Let's dive into the project! 🚀

About the Project
The goal: Pop as many balloons as you can before they escape! 💥

Key features:

Colorful balloons: Enjoy a variety of balloon colors and animations. 🌈
Hotween animations: Smooth and visually appealing animations powered by Hotween. 🍿
Easy customization: Easily modify balloon properties and spawning locations. 🔧
Limitations:

Custom scoring: To implement different scores for each balloon, you'll need to modify the scoring script. Currently, it's a basic system with random bonuses and penalties. 📝
Pause/resume issues: The pause and resume functionality might need some tweaking. 🚧
